# Medieval Conquerors

Medieval Conquerors is a competitive card game where players fight over resources on hexagonal game board. Each player crafts a deck of cards representing their civilization, with various units, buildings, and technologies that aid in their expansion and resource collection.

The goal of the game is to expand your small town and gather enough resources to field a military large enough to overtake your opponent's town center.

Many strategies are available, craft your deck towards early game aggression with cheap units or with the goal of building up strong defensive structures in order to survive until the late game, where much more powerful units can be trained.


The game is still in its very early stages using tons of placeholder art and the main gameplay systems are under construction.
