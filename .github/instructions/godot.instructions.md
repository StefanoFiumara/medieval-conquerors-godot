# Code Style Instructions

## Namespaces
- Use file scoped namespaces that match the folder structure

## Code Style
- Use the target-typed new() when possible
- Place all local functions after a return statement.
- inner classes or structs should be placed at the top of the file

## Comments
- Comments should be used to explain the why, not the how. Let the code be self-documenting.
