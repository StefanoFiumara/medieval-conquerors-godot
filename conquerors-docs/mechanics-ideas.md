## Resource Gathering
- There is a resource gathering step at the beginning of each turn
- Resources are gathered from villagers placed at specific gathering posts
- After this step, players must wait until their next turn to gather more resources

## Action Cards
- Action cards can be played on units to perform a specific action
- e.g. `Torch` action - unit does additional damage against buildings this turn
- e.g. `Brace` action - spearmen units deal bonus damage to mounted units this turn
- e.g. `Shield` action - armored units take less damage next turn
## Zone of Influence
- Players have a zone of influence
- ~~players can build anywhere on the map, but buildings outside of the zone of influence take double damage from enemy units~~
	- Players can only build inside their zone of influence
- zone of influence increases when advancing to the next age
	- zone of influence should increase to take up half the map at its maximum level

## Landmarks
- Civilization specific buildings that give unique bonuses

## Technologies
- Technologies are not applied across all units/buildings on the board, instead they are applied to specific buildings or units to boost that particular unit
	- e.g. double-bit axe upgrades the lumber camp its played on to have increased gather rate
- Some technologies can add more cards into the deck, to be used in future turns
	- "Military Training" unlocks barracks
	- "Archery" unlocks range
	- "animal husbandry" unlocks stable
	- "Agriculture" unlocks farms
- Unique civilization technologies that give special boosts
