# Mechanics Ideas

### Resource Gathering
- There is a resource gathering step at the beginning of each turn
- Resources are gathered from villagers placed at specific gathering posts
- After this step, players must wait until their next turn to gather more resources

### Resource Bank
- Players can only store a certain amount of resources
- storage space is expanded when gathering posts are built (lumber camp, mill, etc.)
- If a gathering post is destroyed, any resources exceeding the maximum available in the bank are lost

### Zone of Influence
- Players have a zone of influence
- players can build anywhere on the map, but buildings outside of the zone of influence take double damage from enemy units
- zone of influence increases when advancing to the next age

### Landmarks
- Civilization specific cards that give unique bonuses
