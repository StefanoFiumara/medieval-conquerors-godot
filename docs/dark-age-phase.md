# Dark Age Phase Guide

The Dark Age is the opening phase of Medieval Conquerors where players establish their foundation for future expansion and military campaigns. Success in the Dark Age sets the stage for advancement to the Feudal Age and beyond.

## Primary Goals

### 1. Grow Economy
Building a strong economic foundation is crucial for long-term success. Players must establish efficient resource gathering operations to fund future military and technological advancement.

**Key Objectives:**
- Establish multiple gathering posts near valuable resource clusters
- Train and deploy villagers to maximize resource collection
- Expand your zone of influence to access more resource tiles
- Balance resource types to meet future needs

### 2. Establish Early Defense
While focusing on economy, players cannot ignore defense. Early military pressure from opponents can cripple an unprepared civilization.

**Key Objectives:**
- Secure key defensive positions around your town center
- Build basic military units to deter early aggression
- Position units to protect vulnerable economic buildings
- Scout opponent activities to prepare for potential threats

## Cards That Support Each Goal

### Economic Growth Cards

#### Buildings
- **Town Center**: Your primary economic hub
  - Garrison capacity: 6 villagers
  - Collects resources from surrounding tiles
  - Critical target - protect at all costs
  
- **Lumber Camp**: Wood gathering specialist
  - Garrison capacity: 3 villagers
  - Expands wood storage capacity
  - Essential for building construction
  
- **Mining Camp**: Stone and gold extraction
  - Garrison capacity: 3 villagers
  - Provides access to defensive stone and valuable gold
  - Often placed in contested areas
  
- **Mill**: Food production facility
  - Garrison capacity: 3 villagers
  - Supports unit training and technology research
  - Can be built near hunting grounds or farms

#### Units
- **Villager**: Core economic unit
  - Must be garrisoned in economic buildings
  - Gathers resources during the resource gathering phase
  - Vulnerable to military attacks
  
- **Settler**: Special starting villagers
  - Free to play (no resource cost)
  - Not discarded at end of turn
  - Use strategically to kickstart your economy

### Early Defense Cards

#### Military Units
- **Men-at-arms**: Basic infantry unit
  - Reliable melee fighters
  - Good for defending gathering posts
  - Cost-effective early military option
  
- **Lancer**: Mounted unit with mobility
  - Can quickly respond to threats
  - Effective against enemy villagers
  - Higher resource cost but greater impact

#### Defensive Buildings
- **Defensive Tower**: Static defensive structure
  - Protects key locations
  - Deters early aggression
  - Requires stone investment

### Technology Cards
- **Double-bit Axe**: Improves lumber camp efficiency
  - Increases wood gathering rate
  - Accelerates building construction
  
- **Military Training**: Unlocks military buildings
  - Provides access to Barracks, Archery Ranges, and Stables
  - Shuffles military unit cards into your deck

## Counter-Strategies: Disrupting Opponent Goals

### Disrupting Economic Growth

#### Direct Economic Attacks
- **Target Villagers**: Attack undefended gathering posts to eliminate villagers
- **Raid Resource Areas**: Use mobile units like Lancers to harass remote economic buildings
- **Contest Key Resources**: Build your own gathering posts near valuable resource clusters to deny access

#### Indirect Economic Pressure
- **Force Defensive Spending**: Apply military pressure to force opponents to spend resources on defense instead of economy
- **Control Critical Resources**: Secure gold and stone deposits to limit opponent advancement options
- **Zone Denial**: Use military units to prevent expansion into new resource areas

### Disrupting Early Defense

#### Economic Warfare
- **Overwhelm Defenses**: Build superior numbers of basic units to overwhelm scattered defenses
- **Target Economic Infrastructure**: Focus attacks on gathering posts rather than military units
- **Resource Denial**: Prevent access to stone to limit defensive building construction

#### Military Tactics
- **Early Rush**: Commit to early military production to attack before defenses are established
- **Multi-pronged Attacks**: Attack multiple locations simultaneously to spread defenses thin
- **Mobile Harassment**: Use fast units to attack and retreat, forcing reactive defensive positioning

## Dark Age Strategy Tips

### Opening Moves
1. **Settler Placement**: Deploy your 3 starting Settlers to secure the most valuable resource tiles near your town center
2. **First Building**: Prioritize a gathering post that matches your civilization's strengths or your intended strategy
3. **Villager Production**: Begin training villagers immediately to maximize early resource collection

### Resource Priorities
- **Wood**: Essential for all building construction - maintain steady production
- **Food**: Required for most unit training and many technologies
- **Stone**: Crucial for defensive structures and advancing to Feudal Age
- **Gold**: Valuable for advanced units but less critical in Dark Age

### Transition Planning
- **Feudal Age Requirements**: Prepare for age advancement by securing required buildings and technologies
- **Military Transition**: Begin incorporating basic military units as your economy stabilizes
- **Expansion Timing**: Plan when to expand beyond your initial resource cluster

## Common Dark Age Mistakes

1. **Over-investing in Economy**: Neglecting military completely leaves you vulnerable to early attacks
2. **Poor Villager Distribution**: Concentrating all villagers in one area reduces gathering efficiency
3. **Ignoring Defense**: Failing to secure key defensive positions around economic buildings
4. **Resource Imbalance**: Over-collecting one resource while neglecting others needed for advancement
5. **Premature Expansion**: Expanding too quickly without proper military support

## Conclusion

The Dark Age phase is about finding the right balance between economic growth and defensive preparation. Players who successfully establish efficient resource gathering while maintaining basic defensive capabilities will be well-positioned to advance to the Feudal Age and pursue more aggressive strategies. Remember that every decision in the Dark Age impacts your options in later phases - plan accordingly and adapt to your opponent's strategy.
