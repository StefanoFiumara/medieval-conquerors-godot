## 1. Introduction
Medieval Conquerors is a competitive card game where players fight over resources on hexagonal game board. Each player crafts a deck of cards representing their civilization, with various units, buildings, and technologies that aid in their expansion and resource collection.

The goal of the game is to expand your small town and gather enough resources to field a military large enough to overtake your opponent's town center. 

Many strategies are available, craft your deck towards early game aggression with cheap units or with the goal of building up strong defensive structures in order to survive until the late game, where much more powerful units can be trained.

## 2. Game Overview
At the start of the game, players draw a set number of cards from their deck and begin with a town center on their side of the map. On each player's turn, they can play cards from their hands to expand their town. In the early game, player's will focus on spawning villagers to gather resources and building gathering posts near resource tiles to increase their storage limits.

At certain milestones, players will be able to advance through the ages, from the Dark Age, through the Feudal, Castle, and Imperial ages. Each age unlocks the ability to play more powerful cards, including new units, buildings, and technologies in order to increase their strength.

## 3. Civilizations
Each deck a player crafts represents a medieval civilization, each civilization has certain unique cards, which may influence the player to adopt certain strategies according to their civilizations playstyle. For example, the French may opt for a stable and attack with cavalry based units, an English player could defend with towers and longbowmen, while a Mongolian player may craft an early rush strategy to defeat their opponent or disrupt their early game resource collection before they can advance through the ages.

English, French, and Mongols are early planned civilizations, with more to follow.

### 4.2. Turn Structure
At the beginning of the game, each player will draw 7 cards for their starting hand. After that, they will draw one new card from their deck at the beginning of each turn.

After the draw phase, and before the player performs their turn actions, any villagers assigned to gathering posts will gather resources from adjacent resource tiles.

During their turn, a player can take many actions:
- Play a card
    - Players are allowed to play as many cards as they are able during a turn, provided they can pay the cost
        - **Building** cards must be played on empty space, and are often constructed with stockpiled *Wood* or *Stone*
        - **Unit** cards require a building to be trained at and have a resource cost to enter the board
            - e.g. Knights cost *Food* and *Gold*, and can only be spawned at *stables*
        - **Technology** cards cost resources to research, they boost certain buildings or units, giving them powerful buffs
- Move a unit
    - Each unit can move once per turn
- Attack
    - Units can attach adjacent units or buildings, even after they've moved
- Activate special abilities
    - Some units or buildings have special effects that can be activated by the player if certain conditions are met

### 4.3. Resource Management
Players must gather the resources laid out on the map to expand their town, there are four kinds of resources:
- **Food** - Used mainly for units and technologies
- **Wood** - Used mainly for structures and some military units
- **Gold** - Used for late game units and technologies
- **Stone** - Used for defensive structures

Resources are gathered by building gathering posts and assigning villagers to work on them. Gathering posts increase a resource's stockpile limit, villagers stationed at a gathering post gather resources from adjacent tiles at the beginning of a player's turn.

Resources are spent by playing cards from the hand, most cards have resource costs that the player must pay in order to be able to activate the card's effect.
